# delta-work

The purpose of this app is to allow user to pick flight destinations and render the results in a tabular form.  
Users can either enter the name of the city or the abbreviation for the airport. Once they do that, 
the results will load with all possible destination for the date selected.

Technologies:
React, JavaScript Flask, Bootstrap, Material UI

Challenges:
The biggest challenge was getting the Python working. This was my first time using Python, so I had to learn quickly. I was able to
get the front end and back end to connect, but I would not get the fields to render to the screen.
